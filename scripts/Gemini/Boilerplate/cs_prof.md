## Tribal Lands Statement
Western Washington University's main campus is [situated on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish Peoples](https://www.wwu.edu/tribal-lands-statement), who have lived in the Salish Sea basin, all throughout the San Juan Islands and the North Cascades watershed from time immemorial. We express our deepest respect and gratitude to our Indigenous neighbors, for their enduring care and protection of our shared lands and waterways.
